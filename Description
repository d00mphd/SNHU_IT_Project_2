Dive into Lich’s Lair, a lean and choice-driven text adventure that speaks directly to your inner dungeon master. 
You choose your class, whether you are weaving arcane spells as a Wizard, hammering justice as a Paladin, riffing battle hymns as a Bard, or cleaving bone as a Fighter. 
Then you descend into a sprawling stronghold where every go North or get Silver Buckler shapes your fate. 
Along the way you will wrest the Rusty Key from its rubble, coax a hidden relic into your hands that only you can wield, and whisper the ancient words “protect, preserve, persevere” into a magical beacon to breach a secret chamber.

Prepare for thematic room-by-room challenges. 
You will rummage through spectral feasts in the Dining Hall, sabotage undead sentries in the Catacombs using blueprints you uncover, and survive a multi-phase showdown with a fallen Arch Paladin in the Secret Room. 
Manage your hit points and inventory carefully, because entering the Phylactery Vault with fewer than seven armaments or without your class’s relic will end in defeat at the hands of the Lich’s necrotic power.

If you emerge with every sword, scroll, and sacred trinket, you unlock one of four endings, from a standard victory to the coveted True Legendary Ending, where your hero ascends beyond mortality. 
Perfect for lore hounds, code geeks, and anyone who craves a tight and choice-driven adventure with just enough semi-spoilers to pull you in for another playthrough.
